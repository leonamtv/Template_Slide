    abstract={The aim of this experiment was to utilize the Inquiry Based Science Education, (IBSE) in order to offer the students a better understanding of the light-matter interaction. The inquiry-based teaching addresses the question of how the students make observations, develop hypotheses about phenomena, and devise tests to investigate their hypotheses. Using IBSE they share responsibility within the group for what concerns answering questions, and use a scientific approach to solve problems.  4<SUP>th</SUP> year students of undergraduate degree program of an Italian Arts Lyceum and 5<SUP>th</SUP> year students of undergraduate degree program of an Italian Scientific Lyceum have experimentally determined the value of Planck's constant, <b>h</b>. They <i>have </i>used respectively two methods: a) current-voltage measurements of a series of different colored LEDs; b) a method based upon the comparison of the incident light beams values of potential arrest with different wavelength on a photo emissive surface, using the photoelectric effect through an apparatus built on an optical bench. This work is an essential part of an apprenticeship developed during the ¡°Professione Formatore in Didattica delle Scienze¡± Master, which takes place at the University of Calabria, with the authors taking part in it as trainees and that will be over in the month of October 2015.},

    abstract = "Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES or HXPS), using hard (2–15keV) X-rays for excitation and high energy resolution, has shown a spectacular development recently, due to its capability for providing an insight into the bulk electronic structure of solids and the chemical composition of buried layers and interfaces lying at depths of several tens of nm. Following a summary of fundamentals concerning photoionization phenomena and transport processes of photoelectrons induced by hard X-rays from solids, examples of core level and valence band HAXPES spectra are presented to illustrate different physical effects. Examples are given of applications of HAXPES in determining electronic structure properties and in surface/interface chemical analysis of material systems of high practical interest. Finally, some perspectives for further developments are outlined."
